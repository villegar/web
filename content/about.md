Hi, my name is Roberto Villegas-Diaz. I am originally from Costa Rica, but I am currently living in [Brookings, SD](https://goo.gl/maps/NUkLRXVfunT2Kx91A). My background is in Business Computing, but I consider myself an HPC enthusiast.

Most of the projects I have worked or I am currently working on, can be found on my Github [villegar](https://github.com/villegar) repository.
